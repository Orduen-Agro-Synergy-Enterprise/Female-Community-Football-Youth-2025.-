# Funding & Support  

The **Community Youth Football Competition** has been a beacon of unity, health, and hope in our local community. Over the past editions, we’ve seen how football inspires teamwork, keeps young people active, and promotes peace and togetherness.  

As we prepare for this year’s edition (December 2025), we invite individuals, organizations, and well-meaning supporters to partner with us in sustaining and expanding this impactful initiative.
